The SOLID principles comprise of these five principles:

SRP – Single Responsibility Principle
OCP – Open/Closed Principle
LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle
ISP – Interface Segregation Principle
DIP – Dependency Inversion Principle

Benefits of Design Patterns
Foresee & rectify future problems easily.
Helps in maintaining binary compatibility with subsequent releases.
Just by following SOLID Principles helps greatly in agile or adaptive software development.
The solution facilitates the development of highly cohesive modules with minimal coupling. Thus, increasing extensibility & reusability.
There are some patterns like Facade, Proxy, etc which encapsulates the complexity in itself to provide easy & intuitive interface to the client. Thus, making the overall system easier to understand & reduce learning curve.
Design Patterns make communication between designers & developers more crystal & precise. A developer can immediately picture the high-level design in their heads when they refer to the name of the pattern used to solve a particular issue when discussing software design.
